# Bounding-Box-Prediction-from-Scratch-using-PyTorch

The focus here is more on how to read an image and its bounding box,  resize  and  perform  augmentations  correctly,  rather  than  on  the  model itself.  The goal is to have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind objectdetection,  which  you  can  extend  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  morecomplex techniques such as YOLO.
